# DosAsm
A set of assembly programs for DOS to gain an understanding of this language (and of size-coding).

Was mostly interested in creating graphical programs with some sort of code-generated imagery (GIF included for each program).
* In order of creation, first was `walks.asm` - it started as an attempt at maze generation on a hexagonal grid but later turned into "agents" just filling said grid with various colors. There also were very bad sounds.

This program required external resources for graphics, animations and custom palette (`hexagon.inc`, `anims.inc` and `palette.inc` - the latter generated by `palette_gen.py`).
* Then there was `rand_art.asm` - generator of random (and color-changing) art via moving blobs that trace a pattern behind them. There already was a bit of sizecoding, but not too much 'cause I liked how the images looked.

* And lastly, `aurora.asm` - an image of aurora behind mountains, which was designed from the start as an excersize in sizecoding. Interestingly enough, it almost hasn't changed in functionality in the process of reducing .com file size from ~350 bytes to just 128 (as an intro, yes).

* To build and run these programs the script `build_run.sh` was created. It requires installed DOSBox and NASM (check version in script!) in the same directory as the script itself and the source .asm file. Used via command `./build_run.sh filename.asm`.
